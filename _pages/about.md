Welcome to my personal web page!

Since October 2018 I am a Chargé de Recherche at Inria Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique as a member of the [TARAN](https://team.inria.fr/taran/) team. From January 2018 to September 2018, I held an INRIA postdoctoral position within the CAIRN team (now TARAN), working on numerical approximation algorithms for energy-efficient computing with [Olivier Sentieys](https://people.rennes.inria.fr/Olivier.Sentieys/) and [Tomofumi Yuki](https://people.irisa.fr/Tomofumi.Yuki/). Until December 2017 I was a postdoctoral researcher in the [Numerical Analysis](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) group at Oxford University under the supervision of [Nick Trefethen](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/nick.trefethen), working on rational approximation algorithms inside the [Chebfun](https://www.chebfun.org/) project. Before that, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/) in December 2016 on work regarding algorithmic and implementation aspects of digital filter design, under the supervision of [Nicolas Brisebarre](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/nicolas.brisebarre/) and [Guillaume Hanrot](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/guillaume.hanrot/). My current research revolves around acceleration of deep learning computations, applied approximation theory, computer arithmetic, convex and integer optimization, and numerical computing in general.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
